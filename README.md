# WebRTC2 / Reforms: The Future of Private Communication Infrastructure ‚Äì Bold. Visionary. Empowering. Clear.

## üöÄ Introducing WebRTC2 / Reforms

**WebRTC2 / Reforms** is more than just a messaging application. It's a foundational shift in how we communicate: a revolutionary, fully decentralized infrastructure for truly private, peer-to-peer communication. We are building a secure, cross-platform, and independent network designed for individuals, teams, and organizations who demand absolute control over their data and unparalleled freedom in their conversations.

At our core, we believe:

  * **Communication is a Right, Not a Service:** We empower users to reclaim ownership of their digital interactions.
  * **Cryptography is Foundational, Not Optional:** End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) is baked into every layer, ensuring your data is always private.
  * **UX is Deliberate Design, Not an Open-Source Afterthought:** We deliver a sophisticated, intuitive, and seamless user experience without compromising on security or control.
  * **Control Belongs to the User, Not the Developer:** You define your communication perimeter, not us.

## ‚ú® What Sets WebRTC2 / Reforms Apart?

**WebRTC2 / Reforms** is engineered from the ground up to deliver a **privacy-first, self-sovereign communication experience**:

### 1\. Unyielding Privacy & Security

  * **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) by Design:** All communications are secured using robust cryptographic primitives like NaCl (TweetNaCl/libsodium) for messaging and WebRTC DTLS for calls, with additional NaCl/Olm for fingerprint verification.
  * **Peer-to-Peer First Architecture:** Connections are established directly between users whenever possible, minimizing reliance on intermediaries.
  * **Self-Hosted Signaling Capability:** Deploy your own signaling server to maintain complete control over your metadata, ensuring no third party can log your connection attempts.
  * **Open Source & Verifiable Builds:** Our codebase is fully open, allowing for community auditing and verifiable builds (akin to Proton or Signal), fostering ultimate trust and transparency.
  * **Zero Logs & Metadata:** We are architected to avoid storing sensitive user data or communication metadata.

### 2\. User-Centric Control & Flexibility

  * **Hybrid Architecture:** Seamlessly blend self-hosted signaling servers with optional cloud fallback, giving you ultimate deployment flexibility.
  * **Flexible Connectivity:** Choose to connect to public, private, or corporate signaling servers, utilize TURN relays for complex network environments, or establish direct connections.
  * **Customizable Platform:** Adapt WebRTC2 / Reforms to meet the unique needs of your business, family, or community, creating tailored communication environments.
  * **Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure:** Future-proof your communications with Docker support, CI/CD pipelines, a robust Django backend for API, token, and file management, and planned support for SFU/MCU and federation.

### 3\. True Cross-Platform Experience

  * **Universal Reach:** Access your private communications across all major platforms:
      * **Web:** Powered by Next.js / React.
      * **Mobile:** Native-like experience on iOS and Android via Expo / React Native.
      * **Desktop:** Seamless integration with Electron.
  * **Unified UX & SDK:** A consistent user experience and a powerful, cross-platform SDK (featuring `useCall`, `useChat`, `useFile` hooks) simplify development and ensure consistency.
  * **Independence from Centralized Push Services:** We don't rely on Google or Apple push notification services, further enhancing your privacy and control.

## üîë Core Functionality (MVP)

The initial release of WebRTC2 / Reforms will deliver essential, secure communication tools:

  * **[WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Video Calls](https://webrtc2.com/):** Secure 1-on-1 video conversations directly between participants.
  * **End-to-End Encrypted Text Chat:** Private and secure instant messaging.
  * **Secure File Sharing:** Confidentially exchange files via an encrypted upload endpoint.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture

We leverage a modern and robust stack to deliver a high-performance, secure, and maintainable system:

  * **Languages & Frameworks:** React Native (Expo, Hermes-ready), TypeScript (ubiquitous), Django Backend (for federation, discovery, and API services).
  * **Monorepo Management:** PNPM + TurboRepo for efficient project management.
  * **UI Libraries:** Tailwind / Nativewind / shadcn/ui for a consistent and modern UI.
  * **Server Components:** Express + Socket.IO + TURN + TLS for robust signaling.
  * **Local Storage:** SQLite/MMKV on mobile, IndexedDB on Web for efficient local data management.
  * **DevOps:** EAS Build / Docker / GitHub Actions for streamlined CI/CD.
  * **Documentation:** Docusaurus for clear and comprehensive project documentation.
  * **Client-Server Paradigm:** Our architecture separates UI from core logic: "Client = UI, Server = Everything else." All business logic and data routing reside on the server, with client applications serving as the user interface layer powered by hooks.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Future Vision

Our phased approach ensures continuous delivery of powerful features:

  * **Q3 2025 (Current Focus):**
      * **MVP Clients:** Deliver core chat and 1-on-1 video calling capabilities across Web ‚Üî Mobile.
      * **Self-host CLI:** Provide command-line tools for effortless self-deployment.
      * **Federation Prototype:** Lay the groundwork for connecting independent WebRTC2 networks.
      * **Comprehensive Documentation & Landing Page:** Detailed guides for users and developers, alongside an informative project website.
  * **Q4 2025:**
      * **Group Calls:** Implement mesh-based group calling, with future plans for SFU integration.
      * **Reforms Cloud Hosting:** Offer a convenient, managed hosting service for those who prefer it.
      * **Public Rollout:** Officially launch WebRTC2 / Reforms to a wider audience.
      * **Monetization Strategy:** Introduce sustainable monetization models.
